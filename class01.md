## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language. It is a way to focus on the content. It uses textual symbols to change the formatting and look of the document. You can **bold** or *italicize* text. You can also create bulleted or numbered lists.

### Bulleted list
- Point 1
- point 2
- point 3

### Numbered list
1. number 1
1. number 2
1. number 3

### You can also create task lists with check boxes
- [x] This is a completed task
- [ ] This is task waiting to be completed

### On github, you can use Markdown in most places
Note: I got this from [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Gists
- Comments and pull requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
