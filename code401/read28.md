## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Can a parent component access the state of a child component?** Yes. You can access the child's state using Refs. You assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. [resource](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-access-childs-state-in-react/)

**What can be passed along in a prop variable?** You can pass anything along in props. This includes integers over objects to arrays. [resource](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component)

**How can a child component “know” the state of another component?** You can use props to pass state to child components. [resource](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-send-state-of-current-component-as-a-parameter-to-another-external-method-using-react)

## Terms

- **component props** Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp)
- **component state** React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders. [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp#:~:text=React%20components%20has%20a%20built,%2C%20the%20component%20re%2Drenders.)
- **application state** If the desktop was a React application we could store all of these data in the state of our app. Think about the React State as a JavaScript object containing all the necessary information needed for our application view. ... React State is essentially a data layer for your React application. [resource](https://ihatetomatoes.net/react-state-management-tutorial-do-you-really-need-redux-or-mobx/)
