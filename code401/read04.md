## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**
1. Better program design and higher code quality
1. Detailed project documentation
1. Reduces the time required for project development
[codica](https://www.codica.com/blog/test-driven-development-benefits/)

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?** When you want to remove the explicity calls from the tests themselves or when you want to invite inexperienced users to share state between tests. [medium](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/the-difference-is-beforeeach-aftereach-automatically-run-before-and-after-each-tests-which-1-b53a3ba5c344)

**What is one downside of Test Driven Development** It seems slower at the beginning. You have to think about interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you can finally start writing code.

**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?** A ES6 class defines a type that can be instantiated while prototype classes is an object instance. The best way to think of this is that the ES6 class will be the same same as its prototype, not a copy. [toptal](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)

**Why REST?** Using a RESTful API means more flexibility. You don't have to worry about data being tied to resources or methods. That allows REST to handle multiple calls while returning different data formats.

## Terms

- **functional programming** Functional programming is easier to understand and more bug resistant. FP binds everything into a mathematical function style. You focus more on what to solve rather than how to solve. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-programming-paradigm/#:~:text=Functional%20programming%20is%20a%20programming,is%20%E2%80%9Chow%20to%20solve%E2%80%9D.)
- **object-oriented programming (OOP)** OOP focuses more on classes and objects. It's used to structure program software into classes which can create objects. [educative](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming#:~:text=Object%20Oriented%20programming%20(OOP)%20is,create%20individual%20instances%20of%20objects.)
- **class** A blueprint for creating objects. [javascripttutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-class/)
- **super** Super is used to gain access and call functions on an object's parent. [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)
- **this** This changed depending how a function is called. But typically refers to the object it belongs to. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)** Developers write tests about how their code should be written and implemented. [codica](https://www.codica.com/blog/test-driven-development-benefits/)
- **Jest** Jest is a JavaScript testing framework
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** This is where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repo. This can be done multiple times a day. [cloudbees](https://www.cloudbees.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)
- **REST** Representational state transfer. It is an application programming interface. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Data Model** An abstract model that organizes data and shows how the data relates to one another. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model#:~:text=A%20data%20model%20(or%20datamodel,properties%20of%20real%2Dworld%20entities.)

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
1. class
2. super
3. TDD

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
1. SQL and NoSQL. More about MongoDB
2. Aggregates/Aggregation
3. Functional programming

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?** I'm feeling more confident in what classes are and how to use super. I remember using them a lot in 301 and felt kind of lost but I feel more excited about it now.
