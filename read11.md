## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Why is access control important?** It's important because it protects your site. It's another layer of security.

**Describe an application that would need access control.** An app that would need access control would be a blog. Users can read. Writers would read, create. Editors would read, create, update. Admin would read, create, update, and delete.

**What is a role used for?** A role is used to determine what priviledges and permissions someone would have. Depending on the role, it would grant different priviledges.

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?** Mandatory Access Control is the most secure access point but it takes a lot of planning. It also needs a high system management overhead. Discretionary is more flexible than Mandatory Access Control but it increases the risk that data will be made accessible to users that should not be given access.

## Terms

- **Authorization** The things that you can do according to who you are
- **Role Based Access Control** Role-based access control is known as role-based security. It restricts system access to users based on their roles. It changes their priviledges and permissions.

- **Capabilities** The permissions a user can do based on their role.
