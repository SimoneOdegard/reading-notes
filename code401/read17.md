## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Describe “The Cloud”** Cloud computing is a lot of things. It has really evolved in the past few years which has made it possible to have resources on the cloud like storage. You can computer and do things without having a computer on your desk. It allocates a virtual machine on the cloud and you can access it from yoru computer. There's also a lot of networking capabilities. You can create a network of yoru own on the cloud.

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?** Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain operating system images. [resource](https://www.netapp.com/devops-solutions/what-are-containers/)

**What is auto-scaling?** AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. You can optimize availability, costs, or a balance of both. AWS Auto Scaling automatically creates all of the scaling policies and sets targets for you based on your preference. [resource](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/#:~:text=AWS%20Auto%20Scaling%20lets%20you%20build%20scaling%20plans%20that%20automate,you%20based%20on%20your%20preference.)

**What is bandwidth?** Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps). [resource](https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/bandwidth)

**How do cloud providers compute service costs?** When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its cloud.

## Terms

- **Server Instances** A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. [resource](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance#:~:text=A%20server%20instance%20is%20a,based%20or%20command%2Dline%20based.)
- **Containers** Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain operating system images. [resource](https://www.netapp.com/devops-solutions/what-are-containers/)
- **Cloud Services** The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. [resource](https://www.citrix.com/glossary/what-is-a-cloud-service.html)
- **Cloud Architecture** Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them. [resource](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture)
- **AWS** Amazon Web Serves, a cloud serves platform
- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** 
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, . NET, PHP, Node. js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. [resource](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) 
  - Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. [resource](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
1. Beanstalk
1. Autoscaling
1. The Cloud

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
1. S3
1. Lambda
1. Content Delivery Network

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?** I'm interested in learning more about Lambda. It's interesting that it's serverless. I'm curious to see that in action.
