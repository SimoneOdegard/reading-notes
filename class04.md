A key to designing a website is understanding your audience. Even if you feel like your audience is broad, you'll need to ask yourself some questions to better understand how to serve your audience. Knowing your audience will influence key pieces about your site. You'll have a better understanding of what design would be best, what type of people will visit, why they are visiting, and what needs you're trying to fulfill.

You could even ask people who fit your audience to help you organize categories together. Once you have your site map, start **wire frames** This is a sketch to create your foundation and framework of your website. Remember, once you start putting your content together, prioritizing and organizing will be key. You want to have a clear message to your audience.

Designers take a look at the following things when creating a website: visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity. Not everyone reads everything on a webpage so you have to learn to communicate and make it easy for the audience to see what you want them to see. With visual hierarchy, you'll want your most eye catching thing to be what you want to be seen first.With grouping, it makes the design more comprehensive. Similarity groups creates consistency for the audience.
