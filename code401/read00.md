## Solving Problems
[link](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

Common mistakes when solving problems during interviews:
1. People typically start writing code as soon as possible. Resist this urge! Take time to understand the problem.
1. Oversolving the solution. Keep it simple, don't get too fancy.

Tips for solving problems (source from the article)
1. **Read the problem completely twice:** Read the problem a few times! Have a complete understanding of the problem. You should be able to explain the problem to someone else. If you don't understand the problem you can't solve it.
1. **Solve the problem manually:** There is a manual process that is the foundation of any code you write. "Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!"
1. **Optimize the manual steps:** try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it. Figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier.
1. **Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code:** Take time to write the steps out. Be sure to capture all the steps.
1. **Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code:** If you have done all the other steps, this will be easy. Take each comment and convert it into a real line of code. If you are struggling you need to break down the problem into smaller steps, or you don't know your programming language well enough to do the conversion.
1. **Optimize the real code:** Take a look and see if you can cut out a few lines of code or make something simpler. Also, make sure your variable names are meaningful.

Do you know your language well enough? You should be able to:
- Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

## Act like you make $1000/hr

People value their time at far less than it's worth. What would happen if an hour of your time is worth $1,000? You'd become more productive, focused, and effective. It takes discipline to not become busy. "The most successful people I know are not busy. They're focused." - Jeff Goins (article). People prize being busy but the busyness is just distraction and procrastination from what really matters. Successful people don't tolerate busywork or distraction. Do less but do it with complete hard focus. Then when you're done, be done. Cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do! 

You teach people how to treat you. If you recognize that your time is valuable, then people will recognize and respect that. It's okay to say no! The most successful people say no to almost everything. In Warren Buffet's case, for every 100 opportunities he is given, he will say yes to 1-2 of them. "Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things".

## How to think like a programmer
[link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

"Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to thinks." - Steve Jobs (article).

THe biggest mistake new programmers make is that they focus on learning syntax and not how to solve problems.

Here are steps to become a better problem solver.
1. **Understand** Understand what exactly is being asked. If you can explain the problem in plain english, then you understand the problem. Write down your problem. If you can't explain it in simple terms you don't understand it.
1. **Plan** Plan your solution. Write down the exact steps. Take time to analyze the problem.
1. **Divide** Do not try to solve one big problem, break it down. Begin with the simplest. Once you solve all sub problems, then you would connect the dots. This is the most important step!
1. **Stuck?** The best programmers who are problem solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than being irritated. Take a step back. Look at the problem at a different angle. We sometimes over look the problem.

To be a good problem solver, you need to practice, practice, practice!

## The 5 Whys
[link](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Sakichi Toyoda developed the 5 Whys technique. 5 Whys typically lead you to pursue a single track or a limited number of tracks.

5 Whys
1. **Assemble a Team** Gather people who are familiar with the problem
1. **Define the Problem** Observe the problem in action
1. **Ask the First "Why?"** Ask why the problem is occurring. There needs to be actual account of things that happened.
1. **Ask "Why" Four More Times** For each answer you generate in step 3, ask four more whys.
1. **Know When to Stop** You've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" no longer provides useful responses. If you haven't found the root cause, you need to keep asking why
1. **Address the Root Causes(s)** Discuss the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from happening again
1. **Monitor Your Measures** Keep an eye on how your counter-measures elimintate or minimize the problem. You may need to repeat the 5 Whys if you need to amend them.
