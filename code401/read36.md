## Review, Research, and Discussion

**What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”** Cookies are smaller, they can be stored both by browser and server, they are sent with requests, and their expiration is manually set. [resource](https://dev.to/sidbhanushali/cookies-vs-session-vs-local-storage-22ja#:~:text=cookies%20can%20store%20only%20a,okay%20for%20their%20use%20cases.)

**Explain 3rd party cookies.** Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited. [resource](http://cookie-script.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-third-party-cookies.html#:~:text=Third-party%20cookies%20are%20cookies,see%20which%20websites%20they%20visited.)

**How do pixel tags work?** Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. It is served just like any other image you may see online. The trick is that the web page is served from the website’s domain while the image is served from the ad server’s domain. This allows the ad server to read and record the cookie with the unique ID and the extended information it needs to record.

## Terms

- **cookies** They are pieces of code that web servers use to put information on a user’s browser, and then retrieve that information at a later time for various uses. [resource](https://resources.marketingeffectiveness.nielsen.com/blog/cookies-tags-pixels-tracking-customer-engagement)
- **authorization** It's a process of granting or denying access to resources. Mostly it happens after authentication.
- **access control** TAccess Control is a way of controlling what resources a user can create/read/update/delete given their role(s) [resource](https://medium.com/teamzerolabs/rbac-vs-abac-in-node-js-backend-321a426faae2#:~:text=Role%2DBased%20Access%20Control%20is,can%20edit%20their%20own%20post.)
- **conditional rendering** The ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API [resource](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/7-ways-to-implement-conditional-rendering-in-react-applications)
