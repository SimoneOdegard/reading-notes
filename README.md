### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is believing you can continue **growing** and **learning**. It doesn't require talent alone. Talent is just a starting point.

#### 3 Reminders on how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
- Keep pressing that "I believe" button. Stay persistent!
- No pain, no gain. It's going to be hard, but you can do it. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Don't give up.
- When feeling doubts like "I can't do this. I can't pick this up." Think, "*yet*!" "I can't do this, *yet*!" "I can't pick this up, *yet*! I have to start somewhere."
