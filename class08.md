Boolean: True or False
- == is equal to. Hello == Goodbye would be false and Hello == Hello would be true.
- === is strict equal to
- != is not equal to. Hello != Goodbye would be true and Hello != Hello would be false.
- !== strict not equal to.
- > greater than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal to
- <= less than or equal to

## 156-157
Logical operators compare the results of more than one comparison operator. Logical expressions will be evaluated from left to right. If the first expression has enough information, then that is all the computer will need.
- && logical and: tests more than one condition. If the expression evaluates to true, then the expression will be true. If one expression evaluates to false, then the expression will be false. 
    + True and True will be true. 
    + True and False will be false.
    + False and False will be false.
- || Logical or: tests at least one condition. If either expression evaluates as true, then the expression will be true. 
    + True and True will be true.
    + True and False will be true.
    + False and false will be false.
- ! logical not: takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. This reverses the state of an expression.
    + !true will be false
    + !false will be true

## 170-173
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will continue running as a loop.
- **For** This is for running a code a specific number of times.
    + Initialization - Creates var i = 0; which would act as a counter
    + Condition - The loop continues until it reaches a specified number.
    + Update - Counts how many time the loop has ran the statement.
- **While** If you don't know how long you need to run the code for, use while loop.
- **Do while** Similar to while. However, it will always run the statements inside curly braces at least once.

## 176
A typical time to use the while loop is when you do not know how many times you want to run the loop. It should keep looping until a condition is met.
