## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Does a deployed React application require a server?** No, when building a React app, it gives you a folder with all the files you need to have a working app.

**Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?** Behavior Driven Development, BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests. BDD verifies behavior instead of implementation. [resource](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/behavior-driven-development-bdd-and-functional-testing-62084ad7f1f2)

**What does npm run build do?** It creates a build directory with a production build of your app. [resource](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)

**Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application** React Composition is a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop. [resource](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/#:~:text=What%20Is%20React%20Composition%3F,or%20the%20implicit%20children%20prop.)

## Terms

- **BDD** Behavior Driven Development, BDD uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests. BDD verifies behavior instead of implementation. [resource](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/behavior-driven-development-bdd-and-functional-testing-62084ad7f1f2)
- **Acceptance Tests** A testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications. Acceptance tests are done in the final phase of testing. [resource](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/acceptance_testing.htm)
- **mounting** Mounting is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components). [resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31556450/what-is-mounting-in-react-js#:~:text=Mounting%20is%20the%20process%20of,element)%20in%20the%20DOM%20tree.)
- **build** npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app.

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
1. setState
1. Event handlers like handleClick or onClick
1. Components

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
1. BDD
1. False positive/false negative when testing React Apps
1. Understanding state and lifecycle a bit more

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?** I'm excited to understand BDD a bit more and how to implement that kind of testing.
