## About me
**Simone Odegard** I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. I have been teaching and coaching competitive dance for 6 years. Previous to that, I worked in sales and service as well as apartment management. I'm looking for new beginnings in the tech industry!
