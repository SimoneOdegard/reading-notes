Julia Rozovsky started an MBA program but found that working in your study group was a source of stress. She found that her competition group was more successful even though they were so different from one another. But why did this happen? Why was her study group full of stress while her competition group were a better fit as a group?

Firms started analyzing and improving individual workers. However, this isn't enough. Most of the day, 3/4 of the day, employees are talking to each other. Studies show that working in teams tend to achieve better results and have higher job satisfaction.

Google has spent millions studying worker productivity. One thing they found was that people who rotate who they eat with are often more productive. It's almost impossible to find evidence that the composition of a team made any difference in success.

Project Aristotle found that influencing group norms were key to improving Google's teams. Teams that do well at one assignment will usually do well on others. The right norms can raise a group's collective intelligence but the wrong norms hurt the team. On good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion. Successful teams have sensitivity toward colleagues. They found that communication and empathy were important.

Project Aristotle has taught people that no one wants to put on their "work face". There needs to be a psychologically safe place where people can feel free enough to talk about their feelings. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
