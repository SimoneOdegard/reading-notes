## Chapter 18
A key to designing a website is understanding your audience. Even if you feel like your audience is broad, you'll need to ask yourself some questions to better understand how to serve your audience. Knowing your audience will influence key pieces about your site. You'll have a better understanding of what design would be best, what type of people will visit, why they are visiting, and what needs you're trying to fulfill.

Once you know your audience, start creating a site map. A **site map** will show how pages are grouped together. It helps you to create the structure. You could even ask people who fit your audience to help you organize categories together. Once you have your site map, start **wire frames** This is a sketch to create your foundation and framework of your website. Remember, once you start putting your content together, prioritizing and organizing will be key. You want to have a clear message to your audience.

Designers take a look at the following things when creating a website: visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity. Not everyone reads everything on a webpage so you have to learn to communicate and make it easy for the audience to see what you want them to see. With visual hierarchy, you'll want your most eye catching thing to be what you want to be seen first.With grouping, it makes the design more comprehensive. Similarity groups creates consistency for the audience.

## Chapter 1
Pages are like newspapers as they have a structure. They use it to communicate to the readers their story and what they want to convey. HTML is used to create the structure of pages. HTML uses tags to create elements. Tags can use attributes to tell us more about what the visual will be. Each website has a header, main, footer.

## Chapter 17
There are a few new differences with the traditional HTML style verses the new HTML5 style. One example being when to use div. In the new style, you will have new elements on their own instead of with div. These elements such as header, footer, article, or even nav will be used to create their own container on the site. This creates a cleaner code that is easier to follow.

Another difference you have to look out for is that not all browsers understand HTML5. They cannot differenciate what is block code and what is an element. You will need to use CSS to show the browser what elements are block elements. You may even need to use some javascript on browswers like Internet Explorer.

Even with these changes, the div will still be used to group related elements together.

## Chapter 8
Over the years, HTML has evolved. You have to be careful because some browsers don't support HTML5 which is still a work in progress. Even though it's not fully complete, you can still take advantage of the new features such as not needing to close tags or as stated in Chapter 17, not needing to use div.

On top of all the code, there is also code for special characters. These are escape characters. For example the copyright symbol is &copy;.


## Keywords
- **DOCTYPE** Each webpage is started with DOCTYPE. This shows the browser what version of HTML will be used. It will help render a page properly.
- **<!-- comment -->** You would use this when you want to add a comment that won't appear on the webpage.
- **iframe** Something embedded into the page. The most common would be a map on a webpage.
- **class** You can use multiple times and associated with CSS. You would see the CSS as: .class
- **id** It can only be used once and associated with CSS. It makes it so you can change a portion of the code once without changing everything. You should see the CSS as: #id
- **div and span** allows you to group block-level and inline elements
