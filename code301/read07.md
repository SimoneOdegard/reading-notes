# How I explained REST to my brother
Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers. These servers sent documents across the internet. He also did reasearch on why the web works the way it does.

HTTP is the first part that tells the browser what protocol to use. It is the foundation of the web and describes the location of something anywhere in the world.

The WWW is built on REST, which provides a resource which is what those things point to. Web pages are representation of a resource. Resources are concepts. Typically, a resource has only a single representation.

Redirect is when a machine communicates to other machines telling them information about a resource that isn't yet on another machine. They use the URL to communicate with each other. The URL let's the systems tell each other about the other's nouns. Along with nouns, verbs are also important. GET is one of those verbs. The browser GETs using the HTTP protocol and does so until all the resources are obtained. When the machine GETs a resource, it will ask for a readable one.

- HTTP GET: retrieve information from each other
- HTTP POST: need to add something to another system
- HTTP PUT: if a system wants to replace something in another system
- PATCH: for a partial update
