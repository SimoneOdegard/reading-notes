## Choosing a Text Editor

### What makes a good text editor?
Everyone seems to use something different. That is because the best editor is the one that you enjoy using the most. 

### What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that let's you write text. You can change how the text is managed and even create a website.

**Important features of a text editor**
1. **Code completion** - This is similar to text prediction. It can complete tags, close brackets, or even close quotation marks.
1. **Syntax highlighting** - This takes the text that you type and changes the color. For example, attributes would be a different color than elements while elements would be a different color than copy. It helps differenciate parts of the code making it easy to read.
1. **A variety of themes** - This lets you change the actual text color options as well as the background color. Dark backgrounds with light and bright text is the go to. It reduces strain and fatigue on your eyes.
1. **The ability to choose from a selection of extensions** - This increases functionality and helps to make coding easier.

### Using Software That Comes With Your Computer
Computers come with a text editor already on them. However, these editors don't have as many features. They are the bare minimum and very simple. When using a default text editor, remember to code in plain text. You will also want to stay organized by creating a folder specifically for your website. Don't forget to name your files with the correct extension. This is very important. Your HTML file should be called "index.html".

### Third-Party Options
1. NotePad++
1. TextWrangler/BB Edit (Mac only)
1. Visual Studio Code
1. Atom
1. Brackets
1. Sublime Text

### IDEs
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of multiple software. IDE is a text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger in one software. IDE is similar to Microsoft Outlook as Outlook does multiple things in one software program.

### Overview
It's important to look at your needs and what will work best for you. If you want to keep things simple and the barebones, maybe using the default text editor that came with your computer would be best. However, it seems like you would find that a third-party option would be better. You will have more freedom in customization, extensions, and even code completion. You should do what would make your work easier for you.
