CSS is responsible for how the element should look. It's what makes a website pretty. Each item has an invisible box around it, you will use CSS to create rules on how the items inside those boxes should look. You will use the selector to create your declaration. A selector is something like p or main. Inside your declaration, you will have your property/properties (color, font family, etc) and the value (what you want the property to look like).

Most times, you will need a seperate CSS file that would look like: example.css. This would be using external CSS. In your HTML you will also need to put code that will allow you to link your .css and .html together. When using internal CSS, your CSS would be within your HTML code. To use internal, you'll need to use the style element. Note: CSS rules will typically appear in a seperate document.

There are multiple selectors to choose from. Each selector can let you change things differently. For a more in depth view, see page 238 in the HTML & CSS book by Jon Duckett.

WHen using colors you have three options, RGB values, Hex codes, and color names. RGB will look something like rgb(102.205.170). This indicates values for red, green, and blue. Hex codes also represent red, green, and blue but in hexadecimal code. It will look like #66cdaa. You can use photoshop or gimp to color pick what colors you want. Color names are predefined and are limited in options.

To easily view content on your webpage, you need to consider things like contrast and opacity. High contrasted background and foreground make it easier to read. You have to be careful that it's not too high of a contrast. Medium contrast is great for when your site is text heavy and there is a lot of reading involved. You'll want to avoid low contrast as it's hard to read and can strain your eyes. 

CSS3 introduced rgba. This will allow you to change the opacity of the color. HSL colors were also introduced. This stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. There is also HSLA where the A stands for Alpha which would be in charge of transparency. Be careful, again, old browsers do not recognize HSL and HSLA.
