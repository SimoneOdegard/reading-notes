Javascripts makes web pages more interactive.
1. Access content
1. Modify content
1. Program rules the browser can follow
1. React to events

Note: Some javascript won't work with Internet Explorer 8 and earlier. You'll have to be careful while coding.

**What is a script and how do I create one?** A script is a series of instructions that the computer follows to achieve a goal. They are like recipes, handbooks, or manuals. You need to have a goal before you write a script. Once you have your goal, you'll list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
1. Define a goal - This is your big picture. You'll need this before you can break things down and start coding.
1. Design the script - You can create a flowchart of the tasks that need to be done. This will help you learn how to get tasks to fit together. You would then create a list of steps from the flowchart. It's like the telling a robot how to put on a hoodie task we did in class.
1. Code each step - Once you have your steps written down, you can start coding. You will need to *think* like a computer so that they can complete the instructions you give them correctly.

### Keywords:
- **Vocabulary** Words that the computer understands
- **Syntax** How you put those words together to create instructions for the computer.

## Pages 74-79
There are 2 types of expressions. Expressions evaluates into (results in) a single value. Expressions rely on operators. They allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable
1. Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value


### Keywords:
- **Assignment Operators** Assign a value to a variable
- **Arithmetic Operators** Perform basic math. This follows the PEMDAS rules.
- **String Operators** Combine two strings. the + symbol is an example of a string operator. 
- **Comparison Operators** Compare two values and return true or false
- **Logical Operators** Combine expressions and return true or false
- **NaN** Not a number

## Pages 88-94
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Functions let you reuse script that would normallhy repeat. Functions can also offer a way to *store* steps needed to complete tasks. The function name should describe the task.

Note: Parameters and Arguments are not the same thing even though they are used interchangeably.

### Keywords:
- **Parameters** Pieces of information pass to a function
- **Return value** When you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer
- **Function declaration** When you give a function a name then write the statements needed to achieve its tasks inside the curly braces.
- **Calling the function** After you declared the function, you can execute all the statements between the curly braces with one line of code.
- **Arguments** When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name.
