There are 3 key languages that are used to create webpages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You need to create seperate files for each. Some people browse with JavaScript turned off so having them seperate allows the website to still work when a user isn't using JavaScript. Remember to link CSS and JavaScript with your HTML file. 
- HTML is the content layer
- CSS is the presentation layer
- JavaScript is the behavior layer. JavaScript is typically added last as it enhances the usability. To link the JavaScript, you need to have script in the HTML.

#### **document**.::write(*'Good Afternoon'*);::
- document is the object. It represents the entire webpage
- the highlighted section is the method of the **document**. It allows new content to be written into the page where the script element sits
- 'Good Afternoon' is the parameters. That is where you put the information so that the script works.
- the . is the member operator. **document** will have several different methods so you'll use the member operator to differenciate between them.

**Note:** The JavaScript does not change the HTML. The script works with the model of the web page.

A *statement* is an individual instruction that the computer follows step by step. Each statement starts on a new line. They can also be organized into code blocks which means they are surrounded by curly braces. *Comments* are used to explain what your code does. It makes it easier to read and understand your code.

*Variables* are when you have to temporaily store the pieces of information. It's a good way to remember parts of code for short term memory. Variables can change each time you run a script. It's very similar to concepts in algebra. *var* is the variable keyword. Variables must have a name in order to be used. Once the variable is created, you can tell it what to do by using the varible name. *Arrays* are special variables that store more than one piece of related information.

Javascript uses Booleans. This means it distinguishes between numbers (numeric date), strings (letters and other characters), and true or false statements.
