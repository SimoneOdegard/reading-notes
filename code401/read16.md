## Review, Research, and Discussion

**Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle** We have a website where your client will be able to interact, and a server that is listening for what the client is doing. The client sends a request via method (REST verbs), a body, and/or headers and will reach the server. From there the server will respond with a status, body, and/or headers. It's important to note that HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) is stateless.

**Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC** The server is listening (app.listen) waiting for info from the client to know what to do in return. Sometimes the server will have a database or API connected. Once it knows what the front end/client is trying to do, then it can respond in a way that makes sense.

**What does it mean to “deploy” an application?** Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device.

## Terms
- **Server** A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. [resource](https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/server)
- **Pub/Sub** The Publisher/Subscriber pattern, or “PubSub” for short, is a pattern that allows us to create modules that can communicate with each other without depending directly on each other.

- **WRRC** Web Request Response Cycle

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
1. Hardware and how software is what makes the computer easy to use
1. The WRRC. It helps having to type it out
1. Pub/Sub, this was brought up in a previous reading but it makes more sense now

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
1. Virtual Machines
1. EC2
1. Elastic Beanstalk and autoscaling

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?** Virtual Machines sounds like it would be super fun to utilize!
