**What’s the difference between a framework and a library?** The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Terms

- **Rendering** Javascript uses the document object model (DOM) to manipulate the DOM elements. Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser. [resource](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-javascript-rendering)
- **Templates** JavaScript templates are a method of separating HTML structure from the content contained within. Templating systems generally introduce some new syntax but are usually very simple to work with, especially if we’ve used templating systems elsewhere previously (eg. Twig in PHP). [resource](https://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-templating-engines/#:~:text=What%20Are%20JavaScript%20Templates%3F,Twig%20in%20PHP).)
- **State** In react, state is a global class variable that is modified when the component updates

## Preview

**Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
1. JSX
1. Refresher on rendering elements with react
1. 

**Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
1. Sass! I feel like we didn't go over sass as much in 301 so I'm interested in learning more.
1. Working more with componentDidMount
1. Hooks

**What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?** I'm excited to work with react again! I feel like 301 was a whirlwind but feeling ready to keep building on my react knowledge.
