What is Node.js? Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used for complining JavaScript directly to native machine code that the computer can execute. JavaScript runtime means that we can use Node.js to execute JavaScript on your computer.

Node has excellent support for ES6. You can write JavaScript using the latest modern syntax. You also don't have to worry about compatibility issues. 

Note: npm = node package manager

npm is the world's largest software registry. You can install a package globally and locally.

What is Node.js used for? Node.js is designed to automate the process of developing modern JavaScript applications.

Node.js is single-threaded and event-driven. This means that everything that happens in Node is a reaction to an event. When there is a new request the server will start processing it.

Node is great for building applications that require real-time interaction, for building APIs, or for data streaming.
