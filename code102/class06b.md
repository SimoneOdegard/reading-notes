## What makes a computer, a computer?
Computers were designed to manipulate informations.
A computer:
1. Takes input - This is what you do to make the computer do stuff.
1. Stores info - These inputs get stored in memory
1. processes info - What is stored in memory is processed by an algorithm (a series of commands). Then sends it back to memory. This continues until results are output.
1. Output results - Output from one comp becomes input of another computer.

## Binary & Data
Computers use 1s and 0s to communicate. Wires can be seen as using 1s and 0s, yes or no, on or off, etc. This is called bits. You can have a lot of bits. With more bits you can represent more complex information. With 32 wires, you can store numbers from 0 to 4billion!

THe binary number system - we only have 0 and 1. These two digits can count up to any number. The computers do the math for us.

## Circuits and Logic
Every input and output of a computer is information. Through a wire, it can be processed by being binary. To make the input as output, they must use circuits!

A simple circuit takes and electric signal and flips it. The signal that goes in, is not the same as what comes out. Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to create different results.

Logic Gates:
- and
- nand
- not
- nor
- or
- xor

An *adder* takes 2 bits and adds them together to calculate a sum. This is a more complicated circuit. The circuits inside a computer is fast at completing these calculations. They're faster because modern circuits are very small. That means it has less distance to travel.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
Input examples: touching a phone, keyboard of a computer, a microphone, gps, sensors on a car, etc. When you input something, it is sent as binary to the cpu memory to calcuate how to display that input. After processing, the result is sent to output in binary and give you the result.

Output example: a speaker play sound, printer printing something, control robotic arm, or even powering a car.

The more complicated the output, the better the processor needs to be.

## Hardware & Software
The hardware of a computer are the circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, etc. You don't see the software. Software are the apps, games, websites, maps, code, programs.

The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. The CPU knows which circuits to use and when to use them. Binary commands are stored in memory and the CPU is what fetches them.

The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardward of the computer.

The thing that makes computers smart is *you*!
